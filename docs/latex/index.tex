This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures implemented in C++ with a focus on efficiency, flexibility, and clear understanding. The project is structured as a CMake-\/based library, making it easy to integrate into other C++ projects or build and test independently.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Key Features}{Key Features}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{CMake-\/based Project}}\+: The library is designed to be used with CMake, making it easy to integrate into larger projects.
\item {\bfseries{Template-\/based Implementations}}\+: All data structures are implemented as templates, allowing them to work with any data type.
\item {\bfseries{Memory Management}}\+: Uses dynamic memory allocation/deallocation where appropriate to ensure efficient memory use and prevent memory leaks.
\item {\bfseries{Iterators}}\+: Some data structures (like {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_vector}{Vector}}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_linked_list}{Linked\+List}}, and {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_doubly_linked_list}{Doubly\+Linked\+List}}) include iterators to facilitate easy traversal and element access.
\item {\bfseries{Clear and Modular Design}}\+: Each data structure is encapsulated in its own header file for clarity, and the library can be expanded with additional data structures as needed.
\item {\bfseries{Comprehensive Testing with Catch2}}\+: The library includes extensive tests for all data structures using the Catch2 testing framework, ensuring reliability and correctness.
