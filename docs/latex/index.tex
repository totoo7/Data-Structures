This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures implemented in C++ with a focus on efficiency, flexibility, and clear understanding. The project is structured as a CMake-\/based library, making it easy to integrate into other C++ projects or build and test independently.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Data Structures Included}{Data Structures Included}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
This library provides implementations of the following data structures\+:\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{1. {\bfseries{Vector}}}{1. {\bfseries{Vector}}}}\label{index_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A dynamic array-\/like container, implemented with templates to support any data type.
\item Includes functionalities like {\ttfamily push\+\_\+back}, {\ttfamily pop\+\_\+back}, {\ttfamily operator\mbox{[}\mbox{]}}, and iterators for easy traversal.
\item Dynamically resizes itself when the capacity is exceeded.
\item Supports copy constructor, assignment operator, and deep copying to manage memory safely.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{2. {\bfseries{Linked\+List}}}{2. {\bfseries{Linked\+List}}}}\label{index_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A basic linked list implementation supporting insertion and removal of nodes from both ends.
\item Includes functionalities like {\ttfamily push\+\_\+back}, {\ttfamily push\+\_\+front}, {\ttfamily pop\+\_\+back}, {\ttfamily pop\+\_\+front}, and iteration support via custom iterators.
\item Memory management is handled with dynamic allocation/deallocation.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item An enhanced version of the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_linked_list}{Linked\+List}} where each node has pointers to both the next and previous elements.
\item Provides efficient access to both ends of the list and supports operations like {\ttfamily insert\+\_\+after}, {\ttfamily insert\+\_\+before}, and deletion from any position in the list.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A queue implemented using a {\ttfamily std\+::vector} to store elements.
\item Supports {\ttfamily enqueue} and {\ttfamily dequeue} operations.
\item Efficient resizing and management of the underlying container.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A queue with a fixed size, implemented as a circular buffer.
\item Operations like {\ttfamily enqueue} and {\ttfamily dequeue} are efficiently handled, with no resizing needed.
\item A perfect choice for memory-\/constrained environments.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{6. {\bfseries{Linked\+Queue}}}{6. {\bfseries{Linked\+Queue}}}}\label{index_autotoc_md7}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A queue implemented using linked nodes, where each node points to the next one.
\item Supports {\ttfamily enqueue} and {\ttfamily dequeue} operations, with dynamic resizing of the structure.
\item Ensures that the queue operations are efficient, with no need for resizing.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A stack data structure that uses {\ttfamily std\+::vector} as the underlying container.
\item Provides standard stack operations\+: {\ttfamily push}, {\ttfamily pop}, and {\ttfamily top}.
\item Dynamically resizes itself as needed, with efficient memory usage.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{8. {\bfseries{Static\+Stack}}}{8. {\bfseries{Static\+Stack}}}}\label{index_autotoc_md9}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A stack with a fixed size, implemented using a static array.
\item Supports {\ttfamily push}, {\ttfamily pop}, and {\ttfamily top} operations.
\item Suitable for cases where the stack size is known ahead of time.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A stack implemented using linked nodes, where each node points to the next one.
\item Allows for dynamic memory allocation and supports {\ttfamily push}, {\ttfamily pop}, and {\ttfamily top} operations.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{CMake-\/based Project}}\+: The library is designed to be used with CMake, making it easy to integrate into larger projects.
\item {\bfseries{Template-\/based Implementations}}\+: All data structures are implemented as templates, allowing them to work with any data type.
\item {\bfseries{Memory Management}}\+: Uses dynamic memory allocation/deallocation where appropriate to ensure efficient memory use and prevent memory leaks.
\item {\bfseries{Iterators}}\+: Some data structures (like {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_vector}{Vector}}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_linked_list}{Linked\+List}}, and {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_doubly_linked_list}{Doubly\+Linked\+List}}) include iterators to facilitate easy traversal and element access.
\item {\bfseries{Clear and Modular Design}}\+: Each data structure is encapsulated in its own header file for clarity, and the library can be expanded with additional data structures as needed.
