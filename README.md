# Data Structures Library in C++

This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures implemented in C++ with a focus on efficiency, flexibility, and clear understanding. The project is structured as a CMake-based library, making it easy to integrate into other C++ projects or build and test independently.

## Key Features

- **CMake-based Project**: The library is designed to be used with CMake, making it easy to integrate into larger projects.
- **Template-based Implementations**: All data structures are implemented as templates, allowing them to work with any data type.
- **Memory Management**: Uses dynamic memory allocation/deallocation where appropriate to ensure efficient memory use and prevent memory leaks.
- **Iterators**: Some data structures (like `Vector`, `LinkedList`, and `DoublyLinkedList`) include iterators to facilitate easy traversal and element access.
- **Clear and Modular Design**: Each data structure is encapsulated in its own header file for clarity, and the library can be expanded with additional data structures as needed.
- **Comprehensive Testing with Catch2**: The library includes extensive tests for all data structures using the Catch2 testing framework, ensuring reliability and correctness.
